# Student accomadation web app
This system made for students to find accomadation and still production.<br>
Although Server-side/Backend is ready for beta version GUI is still not ready.<br>
The system has:<br>
              Adding, deleting, editing accomadations<br>
              Accomadation search<br>
              User profie and registration <br>
              It's own primitive navigation system where ables users to sort by time takes to go to certain university<br>
              Pretty much basic requirements of a accomadation website.<br>
